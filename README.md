 - ## **Development process**

    - ### **Built with**

      - Semantic HTML5 markup
      - CSS custom properties
      - Flexbox
      - CSS Grid
      - Bootstrap (for navigation only)
      - Javascript (including local storage)

    - ### Learning outcomes 

      - #### **Group project**

        As a group we have learnt to read, work with & amend others' code.

      - #### **Coding** 

        Each of the members of the group have learnt and explored something new and below are some examples:

        - Kelven  & Mike - implemententation of css grid and modals as a team
   
          **css grid**
          ![grid](documentation/grid.png)

          **modals**
          ![modals](documentation/modals.png)
  
        - Carlos - implementation of javascript countdown timer 

          ![countdown timer](documentation/countdown.png)

        - Claire - implementation of local storage

          ![local storage](documentation/localstorage.png)

    - ### **Continued development**

      As this challenge was a first group project, it has been an excellent learning experience. 

      For next group project, we should focus on:
        - Agreeing beforehand the languages and frameworks used in developing the project, as some compoments such as Bootstrap may inadvertently affect the overall layout of the page.
        - Spending more time beforehand to understand the requirements of the project so that tasks can be split in a more meaningful way.

    - ### **Useful resources**

      - [Tutorial w3school](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_countdown.asp) - This helped for to create the countdown timer
      - [CSS Tricks post](https://css-tricks.com/change-color-of-svg-on-hover/) - This helped to change the svg colour when hovered / clicked
